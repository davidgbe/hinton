TIMEX-07.zip  contains  the  data  used for  the  Temporal  Expression
Recognition and Normalization Task at EVALITA 2007 (I-CAB Version 4.1).

Data  consist of  525 news  documents taken  from the  local newspaper
L'Adige.   The selected  news stories  belong to  four  different days
(September, 7th  and 8th 2004 and  October, 7th and 8th  2004) and are
grouped into five categories: Attualita', Cultura, Economia, Sport and
Trento.  They are  divided into a development part  (335 news stories,
for  a total  of  around 113,000  words)  and a  test  part (190  news
stories, for a total of around 69,000 words).

Each news story is distributed in the following formats:
- SGML file  contains the source texts (the encoding is UTF-8);
- APF (ACE Program Format) file contains the annotation in the form of
XML standoff annotation, which means that the file as a whole conforms
to XML encoding standards, and the raw data being annotated resides in
a separate  file (i.e.   the SGML file).   The annotations  'point' to
portions of the raw text via indices .

In order to have a clear  visualization of the annotated APF files, it
is possible  to import them  with Callisto 1.4.0 a  freely distributed
annotation  tool developed  by  the MITRE  Corporation (available  for
download from http://callisto.mitre.org).

To import the APF files follow these indications:
1. Mouse on: 'File' -> 'Import'. A pop-up window will appear;
2. Browse to get to the file to import;
3. Select 'ACE Event Task' for 'Available Importer's and 'ACE2004 APFv.5.1.1';
4. Leave the file encoding at UTF-8;
5. Press 'Import'.
